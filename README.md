# Exploring-Pokemon-Data-With-Unsupervised-Learning
This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to explore patterns in the Pokémon universe. It clusters Pokémon based on their base combat statistics using K-Means and PCA, analyzes move descriptions through TF-IDF vectorization, and detects outliers with Isolation Forest.
