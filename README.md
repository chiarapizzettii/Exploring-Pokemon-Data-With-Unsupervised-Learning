# Exploring Pokémon Data With Unsupervised Learning

This project explores and analyzes Pokémon data using various **unsupervised learning techniques** to uncover hidden patterns, natural groupings and semantic similarities within the Pokémon universe.

This analysis aims to:
- Measure similarity between Pokémon based on base statistics.
- Discover natural clusters of Pokémon and moves.
- Apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) to move descriptions to find functional groupings.
- Identify "anomalous" or unique Pokémon that defy standard categorizations.

## **Datasets** 
The analysis is performed on three datasets retrieved from the PokéAPI:
- `pokemon_complete.csv`: Contains data for 1025 Pokémon, including physical traits (height, weight), types, abilities, and base battle statistics (HP, Attack, Defense, etc.).
-
